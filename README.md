CHROMAKEY EXPERIMENT By Joseph C. Richardson

This is a Chromakey experiment to show how you can use bright orange, cheap gloves to achieve some awesome Chromakey Special Effects in your Fantasy Videos. However, using a slow, crappy laptop, I couldn't achieve the 1080p video quality, I so much wanted. No fret, simply view any of my videos, that show poor quality on a small screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP to view much better video quality output.

CHROMAKEY LESSONS By Joseph C. Richardson

Chromakey is soo much FUN! However, using a slow, crappy laptop I couldn't achieve the 1080p quality I wanted but no fret just view it on a small screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP to see better quality output. Most people, except myself, I don't use a cellphone at all. I've always had a strange way of never wanting to answer even a basic telephone. I always had a strange fear of them, ever since I was, I can't even remember how small I was. lol Anyway here is how you can achieve Chroma Key in your videos. This video teaches you how to do it.

VIRTUAL CHROMAKEY Creator Video By Joseph C. Richardson

All you need to do is pause the video on each virtual chromakey image.
Next press CTRL+PrtSc to copy then paste each virtual chromakey
image into Windows paint or any image creating app of your choice.
Save each image as whatever name you choose. Make sure this
video is on 'Full Screen' viewing to be able to capture the virtual chromakey
images only and not the windows background. Next, have fun..

Pay close attention to the Hex Colour Codes, should you want to create
your own virtual chromakey images. With this video, the possibilities are
endless of what you can do with virtual chromakey.

I invented this totally by accident, while playing around with a video editor.
Most of these images are done with TurboCad software and then re rendered
into FLASH software, and some are also re rendered in photoshop 7.0 and
FLASH 4 software combined.

All these Virtual Chromakey images are created solely by:
