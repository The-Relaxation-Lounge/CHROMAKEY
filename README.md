CHROMAKEY EXPERIMENT By Joseph C. Richardson

This is a Chromakey experiment to show how you can use bright orange, cheap gloves to achieve some awesome Chromakey Special Effects in your Fantasy Videos. However, using a slow, crappy laptop, I couldn't achieve the 1080p video quality, I so much wanted. No fret, simply view any of my videos, that show poor quality on a small screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP to view much better video quality output.

CHROMAKEY LESSONS By Joseph C. Richardson

Chromakey is soo much FUN! However, using a slow, crappy laptop I couldn't achieve the 1080p quality I wanted but no fret just view it on a small screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP to see better quality output. Most people, except myself, I don't use a cellphone at all. I've always had a strange way of never wanting to answer even a basic telephone. I always had a strange fear of them, ever since I was, I can't even remember how small I was. lol Anyway here is how you can achieve Chroma Key in your videos. This video teaches you how to do it.
