CHROMAKEY EXPERIMENT By Joseph C. Richardson

This is a Chromakey experiment to show how you can use bright orange, cheap gloves to achieve some awesome Chromakey Special Effects in your Fantasy Videos. However, using a slow, crappy laptop, I couldn't achieve the 1080p video quality, I so much wanted. No fret, simply view any of my videos, that show poor quality on a small screen, such as a cellphone or a Sony PSP to view much better video quality output.
